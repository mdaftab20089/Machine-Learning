## About the Projects
This repository is a collection of machine learning models developed during my learning journey. The goal is to build end-to-end solutions that solve real-world problems using data. Each project focuses on specific tasks such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Some notable projects include:
- **Flight Price Prediction Model** â€“ A project utilizing regression techniques to predict airline ticket prices.
- **Real Estate Price Prediction** â€“ Leveraging regression algorithms to estimate house prices.
- **Line Follower Robot Optimization** â€“ Applying sensor data to optimize robot path-following accuracy.
